          The Brazilian crypto lending platform BlueBenx suddenly shut its doors after announcing they had suffered an "extremely aggressive" hack of 160 million BRL (US$32 million). However, they shared very little in the way of details, leading investors to question the veracity of their story.
          <p>All 22,000 customers of BlueBenx suddenly found them unable to withdraw funds from the platform. The platform also reportedly laid off the majority of its employees.</p>

        <p>
          A misconfiguration in a newly-deployed liquidity pool allowed an attacker to mint 1.2 billion aUSD, a stablecoin built on the Polkadot network. The exploit caused aUSD to lose its USD peg, initially dropping as low as $0.60 and hovering around $0.90.
          <p>Acala paused the protocol shortly after the attack, and disabled the transfer functionality of the stolen aUSD and of Acala-based tokens the attacker had swapped for some of the aUSD. It's not yet clear how much the hacker had successfully been able to transfer off-chain in order to realize any profits from the hack, but it's important to note it was nowhere near $1.2 billion USD.</p>
